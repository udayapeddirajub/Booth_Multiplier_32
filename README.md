# Booth_Multiplier_32
In this repository, I have shared all the files required to design the booth multiplier with radix4 restoring method, also for testing purpose I have included the test bench file, the algorithm is basic and can be understood from any resource I am attaching one of those here, pipeline registers can be included to further optimize the design.
